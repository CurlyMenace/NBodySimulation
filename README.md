# NBodySimulation
A bunch of nbody simulations implemented as a benchmark for testing various threading methods. Both algorithms (brute-force and Barnes Hut Tree) are based on Princeton University lecture notes and their java implementation which can be found under this address http://physics.princeton.edu/~fpretori/Nbody/index.htm
